## Liquid Democracy in Social Choice

This repository contains the source code for the [Liquid Democracy in Social Choice](https://gpapasot.github.io/ld-comsoc/) website.

The goal of this project is to centralize resources and references on research in Liquid Democracy. It provides an overview of (most) existing works in the field, along with a categorization based on the models they employ. The proposed taxonomy reflects a set of criteria that capture the fundamental design decisions underlying each model, helping readers quickly orient themselves and contextualize the works. For a detailed discussion of the motivations behind our taxonomy, the principles guiding the labellings, and how it is leveraged to identify and structure directions for future research in the field, we refer to our [companion paper](arXiv link).

This website is a spin-off of the [Algorithms with Predictions](https://algorithms-with-predictions.github.io) project, from which it was originally forked.

The website and its living survey are maintained by [D. Grossi](https://davidegrossi.me), [A. Nitsche](https://interaktive-demokratie.org/people/Andreas-Nitsche.en.html) and [G. Papasotiropoulos](https://duch.mimuw.edu.pl/~gpapasotiropoulos/). 

Soon we will be able to welcome contributions via GitHub pull requests. Until this feature is fully set up, we encourage community members to contact us directly by email regarding new publications they would like added, updates to existing entries (e.g., link corrections or label adjustments), or other relevant material suitable for inclusion on this website.
