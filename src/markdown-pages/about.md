## About

The goal of this project is to centralize resources and references about the research in Liquid Democracy within the field of Computational Social Choice.

It is a spin-off of the great project for the area of *Algorithms with Predictions* that is led and managed by [Alexander Lindermayr](https://www.uni-bremen.de/en/cslog/team/alexander-lindermayr) and [Nicole Megow](https://www.uni-bremen.de/en/cslog/nmegow), who kindly allowed us to fork their code.
